The VProg competitive programming study groups are continued this semester, organized by [BME VIK SZIT](https://cs.bme.hu/english/)!

The study groups' aim is to work together on improving our competitive programming skills and expanding our knowledge on data structures and algorithms. We solve LeetCode-style exercises on platforms such as Codeforces, SPOJ, etc, in a ['mob programming'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming#Mob_programming) format, mostly using C++ and Python.

We welcome anyone who is interested in competitive programming (however, some basic knowledge of algorithms, such as sorting, binary search, graph travelsals, shortest path, etc and basic programming skills are a must-have, to be able to keep up)! 

The sessions are held online, on Discord. We run both a Hungarian and an English session! :)
